# bgbtech_engine2
Newer in-development engine + misc.

Will upload some code later.

This engine is basically being rewritten ground-up in order to be smaller and more streamlined.

Like the old engine, it is using a voxel system.
Will also use a reimplemented version of the BGBScript VM.


This also contains an MSP430 emulator and basic electronics simulator.
