Ideas for game premise:

Background, Approx 3K Years Prior

Arken, alien race which infiltrated humanity disguised as humans.
* Humanoid, greyish skin, blue-green (copper-based) blood.
** Uncommon on Earth due to an inability to proliferate.
** Disgueses are generally extensive (fake hair/skin and eye covers).
** Have large naturally orangish-red eyes.
* Demi-Arken, genetically-engineered hybrids with red or yellow blood.
** Like humans, have iron-based blood, and more natural looking skin tones.
** Typically can more easily pass for human, and are more common in society.
** Are considered inferior by purebreed arken.
** General ruling class on Earth, which exists as a failed Arken colony.
** Mostly keep their existence hidden from humanity.
** Are able to interbreed with purebreeds, but not with humans or arthians.
* Are responsible for creation of arthians.
** Created as a failed experiment to bridge humans and arkens.
* Arken Lifecycle
** Unlike humanoids, pure arkens have a larval stage and pupation.
** Purebreds on Earth typically have cybernetic augmentations.
*** These are installed during pupation, and are fully incorporated.
*** Needed because otherwise living on Earth would be lethal to them.
** Generally more centralized and industrial than humans.
*** High cost and complexity of individual reproduction.
*** Generally, genetic material is sent back to factories.
*** Adoption is the primary family structure among arken.

The setting at the time was pretty much medieval, with humans living primarily in a feudal agrarian society with walled cities and castles.

Most of the arken population lived in large underground complexes.


Arthien:
* Relatively common, resemble anthropomorphic animals.
** Genetically similar to humans, able to interbreed with humans.
** Much of their genetic material comes from various animal species.
** Also contain a significant amount of arken based DNA.
* Were created by arken researchers as an attempt to bridge the species.
** However, they were largely rejected by their society.
** They also have an uneasy relationship with humans.
*** Their non-human appearance caused them to be largely rejected by humans.
*** Were not cost-effective for centralized brooding.
* Are typically smaller than humans.
** Very commonly have special abilities.

As a general surprise to the arken, when left on their own, the arthians started reproducing by themselves, and quickly outnumbered the arken due to their faster reproduction, putting a strain on the society. As a result, the arthenians were largely exiled to the surface world.


Over the course of many centuries, the remaining arken population on Earth shrunk to the point of being virtually non-existant, and their cities became mostly abandoned ruins. This then left humans and arthians as the main races.

Because of conflicts, they have tended to live in separate cities, and intermarrying is commonly treated as taboo. Those who do often live in secret, or otherwise live apart from society.
