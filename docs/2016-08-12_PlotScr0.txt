First Stage:
* Name: Star Lit Park
* Player: Amanda (Younger)
* Boss: Encounters Jules

Location: End of Stage
Jules:
	No, don't run away!
	I don't mean you any harm.
	Rather, I have a business proposition.
-
	Yes. I could use your help with my robotics business.
	Or, at least, your face.
	You see, for a contract of mine, I need a second source, but as you can see,
	I am the only real player in this industry.
	So, what I need you to do, if you will, is to stand in as my competitor.
	I will supply the funding, and the facilities.
Amanda:
	What's in it for me?
	Why should I offer my services to a scary robot guy?
Jules:
	I will pay you well.
	How about this, I will take you to dinner, and we can talk more about it.
	Also, I assure you, I am not a robot.

Location: At resteraunt (or otherwise getting food).
Jules:
	How is the food and wine, is it statisfactory?
Amanda:
	Yes, very much.
	How about we go back to your place?...

They go back to Jules place, and get it on.
